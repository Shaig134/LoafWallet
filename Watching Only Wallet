Dear sir/madam,

I have a problem with litecoin wallet which i can't resolve without you. Below I will try to explain you the problem step by step, your help much appreciated.

1) I download app - loafwallet

2) Went to receive and got this wallet adress - LPZzPVRwofoyE4qg5NY1rxndn9eJKUJJsM

3) After it registered at paybis
4) Changed 50$ to 0.16 litecoins (used credit card - 5167********6769)

5) Transaction: 880cf68f5c8fea769556087edec443e0e4b3e4c52fe9292ce653179671c7e684
6) When I got back to check my balance at loafwallet, there were 0 and another wallet address
7) When I tried to send from this LPZzPVRwofoyE4qg5NY1rxndn9eJKUJJsM to new generated one, loafwallet were telling me that I can’t send money to my own wallet
As I found out my wallet is “Watching Only” wallet, but I never requested one.
 
Can you please assist me to change the status of the wallet?
